I am going to see if I can send these changes to
github. I set up a remote already, and noticed that
github new repositories do not show up in your
computer filing system.

I have successfully sent changes to github!
the practice is as follows:

create a new repository on github

create a new remote on github

create a new directory in your local computer

open it in atom and make changes

git add, then git commit and git push to send to
github.
